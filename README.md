# UCI Course Scrape

I made this project for two purposes:
  1. scrape.py: scrape courses from uci catalogue and store in Google Firestore to be used for [Planeater](https://github.com/jessicashu7/planeater).
  2. test_autofill.py: test out using this [typeahead library](https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead) (using all the courses in database) in a small Flask app.
